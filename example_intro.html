<p>
Thank you for participating in this study for the Linguistics Program at the College of William & Mary. 
  Your participation provides valuable data for the scientific study of language, and is greatly appreciated. <br /><br />
</p>
<p>
 In this task, you will read some sentences, and rate whether they sound like acceptable, natural sentences of English. 
  You will rate the sentences along a 7-point scale (1=BAD, 7=GOOD).<br><br> If you think the sentence sounds acceptable and 
  natural, then give it a high rating (e.g. 7). If you think that the sentence is not acceptable, or if it is not 
  a possible sentence of English, then give it a low rating (e.g. 1). Some sentences will sound in the middle, and you should rate them in the middle.<br><br>
</p>
  
<p>
  Below are some example sentences with some corresponding ratings:<br><br>
  
  a. The kids decorated the paper with shiny stickers.  = 7<br>
  b. The kids decorates the paper with shiny stickers. = 1 or 2<br>
  c. The kids decorated onto the paper the shiny stickers. = 2 or 3<br>
  d. The purple elephant played chess with the balding porcupines. = 7 <br><br>  
</p>
  <br>
<p>
  Do <em>NOT</em> rely on the length of the sentence to judge if it is good or bad. Also, do not judge whether the sentence is acceptable according to "school grammar," i.e. the rules
  you may have learned in high school English, or in writing classes. You're just being asked to judge whether the sentence sounds
  like natural English that you or other speakers of English would use. For example, you might have learned not to end a 
  sentence with a preposition, but most English speakers find sentences like (e) completely natural and acceptable.<br><br>
  
  e. The old woman hated the people who she was traveling with. = 7<br><br>
</p>  
<p>
To rate the sentences, you can use the numeric keypad on your keyboard, or click the buttons on the screen. You can
take as much time as you want to read the sentences (within the 1 hour time limit). But don't spend too much time thinking about it. 
  Just go with your instant, initial judgment.<br><br></p>  
  
<p>
We have included baseline sentences interspersed throughout the experiment. These sentences are easy to judge, 
  so if you're paying attention you'll have no problem responding correctly. If you get too many of these incorrect, we will take 
  this as an indication that you are either not a native speaker or were not giving the task your full attention. Under those 
  circumstances, we cannot pay you for the HIT.<br><br>
</p>  
<p>
At the end of the task, you will receive your code to enter back in the Mechanical Turk page.<br><br>
  
</p>  
<p>
After you fill in the information below, the study will go over a few practice examples with you. Everything you enter below
is confidential. This is purely for scientific research conducted at the College of William & Mary. If you have any questions
  or concerns, please contact Dan Parker at dparker@wm.edu.<br><br></p>
